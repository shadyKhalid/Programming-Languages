                <p>JavaScript is best for cross-platform app development, mobile apps 
                    used for various platforms, and web browsing. It smoothly runs in 
                    other environments, outside of browsers, and can be compiled 
                    from a wide array of programming languages.</p>

                <p>C is a general-purpose, procedural computer programming 
                    language supporting structured programming, lexical variable 
                    scope, and recursion, with a static type system. By design, C 
                    provides constructs that map efficiently to typical machine 
                    instructions. It has found lasting use in applications previously 
                    coded in assembly language.
